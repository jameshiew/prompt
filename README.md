# prompt

WIP tool for reading files from the current directory into a prompt, respecting .gitignore and .promptignore files. Still experimenting with functionality as needed.

## Basic usage

```shell
prompt # copies straight to clipboard and prints summary
prompt --format json --stdout # prints prompt content as json to stdout
prompt -p src/ app/ -e out/  #Â include/exclude certain paths/globs
```
